<p>In the following table a detailed list of gains is given (gains are portions of disposals which have been assigned a
    cost basis according to the given rules). The given gain type is the rule used to calculated the
    gain. Note "FIFO (future)" indicates the gain is calculated by matching the disposal using FIFO on future trades.
    "Unaccounted" indicates that there is no corresponding by for that portion of the disposal and therefore the cost
    basis is set to 0. Amount is the amount of the disposal accounted for in this gain.</p>
